summary:   The reference EdgeX App Service Configurable
title: EdgeX App Service Configurable
description: |
  The reference EdgeX app-service-configurable is built using the App
  Functions SDK. This service is provided as an easy way to get started
  with processing data flowing through EdgeX. This service leverages the
  App Functions SDK and provides a way for developers to use configuration
  instead of having to compile standalone services to utilize built in
  functions in the SDK. For a full list of supported/built-in functions
  view the documentation located here:

  https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/1.2/microservices/application/ApplServices/

  Initially the daemon in the snap is disabled - this allows the configuration
  to be modified and provided to app-service-config in
  "$SNAP_DATA/config/app-service-configurable/res" before starting.
